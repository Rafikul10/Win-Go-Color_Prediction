# Win-Go-Color_Prediction

About Dataset- This is a Win and Go type contest where one have to predict the color which upon predicting correctly will double or tripple the money. There is some data generated along with the color where we can make use of it to predict the color. So I was curious to apply any Machine Learning or Deep Learning Models upon it to just look whether the models can catch the pattern or not. But model does pretty good on this Dataset.I used RandomForestClassifier to solve this problem.
